# freerollio
## General Info
Freerolls are bets for self motivation and accountability. They are a way to put your money where your mouth is. You can create a freeroll for any goal you want to achieve. If you achieve your goal, you get your money back. If you don't, your money goes to a charity of your choice.

Freerollio is a decentralized application that allows you to create and participate in freerolls. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to manage freerolls.

## Usage
Currently, you need to have a metamask account and browser extension (visit the extension store in your browser and search MetaMask). Two freeroll factory contracts are deployed: One on the ethereum main chain and one on the Goerli test chain. You can use the Goerli test chain to test out the application. You can get test ether from the [Goerli faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/).
